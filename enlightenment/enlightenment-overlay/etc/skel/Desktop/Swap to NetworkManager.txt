Included in the Manjaro Enlightenment edition is a script to swap from
Connman+EConnman to NetworkManager+NM-applet.

This is probably only of interest to people with particular mobile
broadband hardware or those wanting to connect to some enterprise wifi
networks.

You should not run this script if everything is working fine. Just keep
using Connman, which is best supported within Enlightenment.

It's safe to test out the script in live mode.

If you do need to swap to NetworkManager you should run the script
*immediately* after installation, BEFORE performing a system update.

To run the script, open Terminology (the included terminal) and input:


/opt/manjaro-enlightenment/nm-swap-ui.sh


You should NOT run this as root (Do NOT run it with sudo), just open a
terminal as normal and enter it exactly as above.

If you are not going to swap to NetworkManager, or after you have
successfully swapped to it, you can delete the folder with the scripts
and packages:


sudo rm -r /opt/manjaro-enlightenment


...and delete this text file off your desktop. :)
